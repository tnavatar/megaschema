    "An independent, evidence-based argument that may support or refute the validity of a specific Proposition. The strength and direction of this argument is based on an interpretation of one or more pieces of information as evidence for or against the target Proposition.",
    :comment
    "Evidence Lines are used to capture various pieces of information (i.e. 'evidence items') that are assessed together as an argument for or against some 'target proposition' - to report the direction (supports or disputes) and strength (e.g. strong, moderate, weak) that the argument is determined to make. For example, the various allele counts and population frequency calculations for the BRCA2 c.8023A>G variant in the ExAC database are evidence items that may be collectively assessed to build an EvidenceLine making argument of 'moderate' strength that 'supports' a target Proposition that the variant is pathogenic for Breast Cancer.\nEvidence Lines are flexible with respect to the granularity of arguments they support, and the scope of evidence items they can collectively assess. Narrow scoping will bucket available evidence into many, fine-grained Evidence Lines that make the most atomic independently meaningful arguments possible. The ACMG Variant Pathogenicity Interpretation Guidelines are an example of a fairly fine-grained evidence interpretation framework. Broader scoping approaches may organize the same available evidence into fewer Evidence Lines that build and assess less atomic arguments based on a wider and more diverse set of evidence items. For example, CIViC curators assess the strength and direction of evidence items at the level of *all information reported in a publication for a specific study* - which can encompass many different results and evidence types that under more fine-grained interpretation approaches might be split apart and assessed as separate lines of evidence.",
